## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
I did this project to put what I learned in my first week of bootcamp about CSS and HTML to the test. Through completing the acception criteria i was able to find and debug some issues within the HTML structure and condense a lot of redundant information in the style.sheet. I also learned how to deploy my webpage and upload my homework.
